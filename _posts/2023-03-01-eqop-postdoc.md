Myself, together with my colleagues Davide Vega D'Aurelio and Mats Daniels have successfully been granted funding for a postdoc position with focus on equal opportunities aspects in IT. Each position will have a 2-year duration. The positions are planned to start from June 2023 or as soon as possible after that, so we will be sharing the announcement soon.

In the meantime, here is a picture of our celebratory cake!
