I am very happy to announce the first publication by WISDOM! Please take a look at our white paper titled [Promoting Gender Equality and Inclusivity in EURO Activities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342639072_Promoting_Gender_Equality_and_Inclusivity_in_EURO_Activities_WISDOM_Forum_White_Paper).


The EURO WISDOM Forum (Women In Society: Doing Operational Research and Management Science) was created in January 2020 and at the moment consists of 21 members nominated by EURO and the national OR societies of France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden (me!), Turkey and The United Kingdom.
