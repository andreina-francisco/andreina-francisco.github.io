I am very happy to share 

One of those things that have been in the back of my mind for a very
long time is hearing Ã…sa Cajander talk about leadership courses.  I've
heard her talk about how useful and inspiring those courses can be, and
she even wrote a [blog post](https://www.asacajander.se/2019/06/05/celebrating-finishing-my-10th-leadership-course/) about how many leadership courses she has taken!
