I am very happy to share my research presentation at
[ModRef 2020](https://modref.github.io/ModRef2020).  I presented my
first paper at ModRef 2011 when I was a master student and I loved
being back again after so many years. 

These are strange times we're living in, and recording my presentation in advanced
was a new experience, which turned out to be more challenging than I
anticipated.  In the end I learned something new and I greatly enjoyed
both ModRef and CP this year.  The extra fun part of recording the
presentation is that now I get to share! You can also look at the
[slides](/slides/2020-09-07-plate-design-first-steps.pdf) and the [extended abstract](https://modref.github.io/papers/ModRef2020_A%20Constraint%20Programming%20Approach%20to%20Microplate%20Layout%20Design.pdf) that go with it.
