As an academic, publishing is a key part of my work.
To be honest, sometimes writing is an amazing part of my job, but others I feel like I need any and every bit of help.
I have seen "Writing your journal article in twelve weeks" by Wendy Laura Belcher being recommend in several places,
and when I saw it recently during a postdoc training workshop I decided it was time to give it a try. So here I am, all ready to work!
