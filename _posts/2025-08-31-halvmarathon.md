YAY! Yesterday I ran my first half marathon!!! I've been running for many years, but this Spring was the first time I convinced myself I could do it. I feel like there were more ups and downs with my training this year, but in the end, I did it. I pushed through the pain and the self-doubt. Today, I'm a winer, and tomorrow I'll just find my next challenge and continue the fight against my self doubt.
