I had the pleasure of participating in my first (and hopefully not last!) Dagstuhl Seminar: [SAT Encodings and Beyond](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23261). Dagstuhl Seminars are invite only events organised by Schloss Dagstuhl (Leibniz Center for Informatics) that bring together leading researchers and practitioners in specific fields of computer science. I've been hearing a lot about Dagstuhl over the years, and the experience lived up to the hype. It was not only filled with many interesting talks, but it also allowed me to reconnect with colleagues and finally meet people I've been talking to during the past few years in person.
