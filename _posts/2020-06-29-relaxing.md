During my latest meeting with my career coach we started talking about actively and purposely taking some time off.  It turns out that I need social activities to be able to disconnect from work, but staying close to my laptop and phone all day is not exactly helping me relax. Given that it's not exactly easy to meet my friends for coffee right now, I commited to try some of the other things I used to do to relax and ended up having a lovely weekend.  The goal was to actively do something to rest, instead of simply trying to wacth some TV, chatting, and letting time go by.  I went running/walking with my daughter, cooked a little (the french toasts were great!), knitted a little, and read a little (finished "The Forking Trolley: An Ethical Journey to The Good Place" by James M. Russell, and started "A Short History of Nearly Everything" by Bill Bryson).
