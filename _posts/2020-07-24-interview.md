My [welcome interview](https://pharmb.io/blog/andreina-new-postdoc/) has just been published!  I am very happy and proud to be part of the Bioinformatics Research group. I have been here for almost 2 months now and so far, so good.  This is fresh and stimulating environment and I'm looking forward to all the amazing things we'll do in these two years.

Now let the adventure begin!
