You have now the opportunity to [**apply**](https://www.jobb.uu.se/details/?positionId=686103) for a postdoctoral position with me in decision support using constraint programming at Uppsala University. We seek a postdoctoral fellow in computer science or mathematics, with a focus on a relevant field such as constraint programming, combinatorial optimisation, or operations research.  The project will involve exploring a range of possible directions, including but not limited to:

* Devising specialised models and methods for solving problem substructures in the context of laboratory experiment design.

* Investigating the hybridisation of constraint programming and other artificial intelligence methods for reasoning and prediction, such as active learning, applied to drug discovery for brain tumours.

This postdoctoral position is a 2-year career-development appointment focused on research and includes teaching (20%). 

The candidate will be hosted by the [Optimisation Research Group](https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/optimisation?lang=en) at the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.it.uu.se/first?lang=EN) and will be working very closely with members of the group and interdisciplinary collaborators.
