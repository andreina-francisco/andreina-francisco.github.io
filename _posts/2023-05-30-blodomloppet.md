I just ran [Blodomloppet](https://blodomloppet.se/) in Uppsala for the fourth time! This year is particularly especial for me because my daughter also decided to run Lilla Blodomloppet and I couldn't be more proud! The weather was really nice this year, and as usual, it's a very nice atmosphere. I find this race energising and an excellent way to start the running season for me.

Blodomloppet is both about promoting a healthy lifestyle as well as drawing attention to the need for more blod donation. Wherever you are, please consider donating blod. If you're currently living in Sweden, please visit [geblod.nu](https://geblod.nu)
