Today, I was part of a panel discussion about career opportunities after your PhD. The panel was part of a PhD Day event organized by TNDR, which is the PhD student council at the Faculty of Science and Technology at Uppsala University. The whole event was very well organized. I got to see an old friend and talk to really interesting people. 

I remember attending TNDR meetings and events as a PhD student. Now it feels both strange and rewarding to go back and share my story.
