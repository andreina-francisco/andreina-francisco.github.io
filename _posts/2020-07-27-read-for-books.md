My daughter and I read together during
[Read for Books 2020](http://www.nationalreadingmovement.sg/read-for-books/).
Read for Books is a Singaporean charity book drive that aims to raise
awareness of reading. For every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, 1
book will be donated to the children beneficiaries.

We read a lot this year! Not as much as I had been planing to read,
but at least much more than in previous years.  My loving and
energetic daughter is currently in love with her big book of colors,
and so we read that one most days. Other than that, we read "I Can
Read with my Eyes Shut!" once, just once! At least the big book of
colors is quite fun!

I also managed to read a little bit by myself (see the picture for
some of the titles), which is a welcome
change from previous years.
