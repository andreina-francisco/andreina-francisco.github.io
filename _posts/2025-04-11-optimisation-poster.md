Today, I had the pleasure of attending the opening of the renewed poster exhibition at the Ångström Laboratory, where my own poster is now on display. I’m very excited to have the opportunity to share the essence of my research area with a wider audience! This permanent exhibition is aimed mainly at high school and undergraduate students, although researchers in many other areas, such as chemistry and batteries will now by walking by this hallway every day.

Creating the poster was a rewarding challenge—I aimed to present optimisation in an accessible way, hoping to spark curiosity in the area. It took multiple rounds of feedback to get examples that were easy-to-understand, mathematically correct, and technically challenging nonetheless!

Here is a picture of the Swedish version from today :-)
