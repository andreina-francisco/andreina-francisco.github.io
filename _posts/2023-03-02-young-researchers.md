Today I had the honour of being a part of the jury in the semifinals of the [Unga Forskare (young researchers) exhibition](https://ungaforskare.se) 2023. This is Sweden's largest science fair and competition for high school projects in science, technology and mathematics.

It was a pleasure to see so many interesting and creative projects in a wide range of topics from students who clearly have the potential to become scientists. I also got to practice my Swedish quite a bit! (Jag heter Andreina och jag Ã¤r forskare i artificiell intelligens). 

Here are some pictures!
