I recently gave an [interview](https://acmweurope.acm.org/womencourage-past-chair-the-importance-of-working-together/) about my experience co-chairing womENcourage 2015. A lot of time has past since Virginia Grande and I co-chaired womENcourage and it still feels as a very distinctive experience in my life. So many good memories, so much personal growth, so many great people, so much stress, and at the same time, so much fun! I would like to thank again everyone in the team: we wouldn't have done it without all of you! Also thank you Bev and Reyyan for trusting us and believing we could do it! And of course, thank you Virginia for being the best co-chair I could have wished for! I am really lucky to have you in my life.
