My daughter and I read together during [Read for Books 2019](http://www.nationalreadingmovement.sg/read-for-books/).
This time we read mostly books in English, which included "Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?" and an Atlas. I guess it's difficult to know what a child might like...

I hope we can participate again next year!
