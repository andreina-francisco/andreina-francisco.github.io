My daughter and I read together again this year for 
[Read for Books 2021](http://www.nationalreadingmovement.sg/read-for-books/).
I love our little Singaporean tradition! She still remembers our time in Singapore and frequently talks about it,
so I really enjoy keeping some connection to those times.
Read for Books is a Singaporean charity book drive that aims to raise
awareness of reading. For every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, 1
book will be donated to the children beneficiaries.

We didn't read as much this year because my parents came to visit us, but as long as we get to read a bit more days, I'm happy.
I also got to start some new books in Spanish that my parents brought me, so there is that :-)
