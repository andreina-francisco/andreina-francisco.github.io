It's that time of the year, when the Swedish summer is over, we're all back to work and getting ready to start teaching very soon.
I'm very excited that I get to teach the artificial intelligence course again this year and I'm looking forward to meeting tons of amazing students again.
We're going to back to on-campus teaching, and even though I'm looking forward to spending less time in front of the computer and more time seeing people
in person, I'm not sure how well it will all work.

For now, I just prepared a short 5-min introductory video to the course that I hope prospective students will find very informative!
