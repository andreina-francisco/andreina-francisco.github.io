  puzzle."<br>&mdash; Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in

  <p>I am an Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.it.uu.se/">Department of
      Information&nbsp;Technology</a>, <a
  href="http://www.uu.se/en/">Uppsala&nbsp;University</a>, where I am a member of the
		<a
      href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/optimisation">Optimisation&nbsp;Group</a>. I
      am also a teacher representative on the programme board of the Master Programme in Computer Science.</p>
  
  <p>During my postdoc years, I was first a Research Fellow working in the group
	of <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/ryap/">Professor&nbsp;Roland&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Yap</a>
	at the Department of Computer&nbsp;Science,
  <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Singapore</a>,
	and later on I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in
    the <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/department/pharmaceutical-biosciences/research/pharmaceutical-bioinformatics">Pharmaceutical
    Bioinformatics Research Group</a> led by
    <a href="https://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N2-878">
    Professor Ola&nbsp;Spjuth</a> at
    the <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/department/pharmaceutical-biosciences">Department of
    Pharmaceutical&nbsp;Biosciences</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uu.se/en/">Uppsala&nbsp;University</a>. </p>
	
  <p>My doctoral research was carried out at the Department of Information&nbsp;Technology,
	<a href="http://www.uu.se">Uppsala&nbsp;University</a>
	under the supervision of <a
	href="https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N96-5972">Associate
	Professor Justin Pearson</a> and <a href="https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N99-130">Professor Pierre Flener</a>.</p>

  <p>In my free time I enjoy trying to take over the world with my
   awesome nine-year-old, hanging out
   with friends, running, baking, reading detective novels, knitting, eating out,
   travelling, and experiencing new things.</p>
